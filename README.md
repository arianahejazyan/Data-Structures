## Overview

Welcome to my C++ Data Structures and Algorithms repository! ðŸ’– 

This project is all about learning and growing as a programmer. Here, I've implemented various data structures and algorithms from scratch, purely for educational purposes. It's a simple and efficient collection that I hope can be helpful to others who are on a similar learning journey!

## Getting Started

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arianahejazyan/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd data-structures-and-algorithms
    ```

3. **Create a build directory and navigate to it:**

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

4. **Run CMake to configure the project:**

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

5. **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    make
    ```

##  Contributing
Iâ€™m so glad you're interested in this project! However, since this repository is my personal learning space, I won't be accepting contributions. Iâ€™m really committed to implementing everything myself as part of my educational journey. But, I would love to hear from you if you find any errors or bugs, feel free to report them! Your feedback will help me improve and learn even more. ðŸŒ·

Thank you for understanding, and I hope you find my work useful in your own studies!
